# MQTT Subscriber - Android Mobile Project
This project demonstrates a basic MQTT subscriber application developed using Java in Android Studio. The app subscribes to MQTT topics and processes incoming messages based on predefined criteria.

## Features
- **MQTT Subscription:** Subscribes to MQTT topics and listens for messages.
- **Threshold Alerts:** Generates a notification alert if the gas threshold value (`seuil`) exceeds 1500.
- **Background Notifications:** Delivers notifications even when the app is not running or is closed.

## Testing
**MQTT WebSocket Platform:** For testing, use an MQTT WebSocket platform to publish messages.
